            There was an error while crawling or updating the station data. Please check the [workflow logs](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}) for more details.
            
            Common issues:
            - Network connectivity problems during crawling
            - Rate limiting from the transit website
            - Parsing errors due to website changes
